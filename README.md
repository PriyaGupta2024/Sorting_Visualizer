# Sorting_Visualizer
# Using Python
Delighted to share my latest creation - A Sorting Algorithm visualizer that brings algorithms with vibrant colors.
A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that not only provides an immersive experience but also serves as a crystal-clear guide to one fundamental part of the DSA topic - Sorting! (e.g.,Bubble Sort,Merge Sort,Quick Sort).


TECH STACK:
Tkinter: Crafting an intuitive GUI for seamless interaction.


FEATURES:
-Dynamic GUI with option buttons,range customization, and speed control.
-Utilized the Canvas module to create a visually appealing representation of sorting algoritms,enhancing the learning experience through color-coded elements.


What I've Learned:
This project was a journey into the intricacies of sorting algorithms, overcoming challenges like indentation errors, and expanding my skills in importing external files. A testament to my commitment to constant learning and growth as a developer.
